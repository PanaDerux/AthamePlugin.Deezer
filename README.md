# AthamePlugin.Deezer

This is the Deezer plugin for [Athame](https://github.com/svbnet/Athame).

Please note that while the settings of the plugin have login options, they do nothing,
and this plugin does not require (or even support) a Deezer account.

Thanks a ton to [Joe](https://github.com/svbnet), as his previous plugins provided many useful helper methods
(notably the EnglishArtistNameJoiner and RadioButtonEnumMapper).

Feel free to open issues here if you have them, but I'll also try to watch the main
Athame application issues for those that are relevant.
